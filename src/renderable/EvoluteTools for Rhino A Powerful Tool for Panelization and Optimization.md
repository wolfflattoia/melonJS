# EvoluteTools for Rhino: A Powerful Tool for Panelization and Optimization
 
If you are looking for a way to design and optimize complex panelized surfaces in Rhino, you might want to check out EvoluteTools, a plugin that offers a range of features for creating and analyzing multi-resolution meshes. EvoluteTools is available in two versions: LITE and PRO. In this article, we will compare the features and benefits of both versions and show you some examples of what you can achieve with EvoluteTools.

## What is EvoluteTools?
 
EvoluteTools is a plugin for Rhino that allows you to design and optimize panelized surfaces using multi-resolution mesh modeling and mesh optimization. Multi-resolution mesh modeling means that you can control the level of detail and complexity of your mesh at different regions, creating smooth transitions between different panel types. Mesh optimization means that you can adjust your mesh to meet various criteria, such as closeness to a reference surface, fairness (smoothness) of the polylines, planarity of the panels, edge length distribution, sphere packings, and more.
 
EvoluteTools can handle hybrid meshes, which are mixtures of triangles, quads, pentagons, hexagons, and other polygons. It can also handle N-gon meshes (PolyMeshes), which are meshes with arbitrary number of sides per face. EvoluteTools also provides several analysis modes to help you evaluate your design, such as closeness to a reference object, planarity of panels, edge length distribution, etc.
 
## What are the differences between EvoluteTools LITE and PRO?
 
EvoluteTools LITE is a free version of EvoluteTools that offers basic functionality for designing and optimizing panelized surfaces. It has no limitations on mesh size or panel count, so you can use it for any project. However, it has some restrictions on the features and options available for mesh optimization and analysis. For example, it does not support planarity optimization, edge length optimization, co-planar seams optimization, advanced closeness optimization, etc.
 
EvoluteTools PRO is a paid version of EvoluteTools that offers advanced functionality for designing and optimizing panelized surfaces. It has all the features of EvoluteTools LITE plus many more options and tools for mesh optimization and analysis. For example, it supports planarity optimization, edge length optimization, co-planar seams optimization, advanced closeness optimization, etc. It also supports scripting with c# or Python for customizing your workflow and automating tasks.

## What are some examples of projects done with EvoluteTools?
 
EvoluteTools has been used by many architects, designers, engineers, and artists to create stunning panelized surfaces for various projects. Here are some examples:
 
- KREOD by Pavilion Architecture: A pavilion composed of hexagonal panels created with EvoluteTools LITE[^1^]
- Zaha Hadid Architects: Several projects featuring complex curved surfaces optimized with EvoluteTools PRO[^2^]
- Shigeru Ban Architects: A museum facade featuring triangular panels optimized with EvoluteTools PRO[^2^]
- Evolute GmbH: A sculpture featuring N-gon panels created and optimized with EvoluteTools PRO[^2^]

## How can I get started with EvoluteTools?
 
If you want to try out EvoluteTools for yourself, you can download the plugin from their website[^3^]. You will need Rhino 6 or Rhino 7 for Windows to run it. When you run the plugin for the first time, a registration window will appear asking for your email address, where you will automatically receive your license key.
